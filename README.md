  "message": "Censys AI Summarization API is running!",
  "version": "2.0",
  "api": "OpenAI Responses API"
}

# Test summarization endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"test": "sample host data"}, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}'

# Expected: JSON response with summary and metadata
```


## ü§ñ AI Techniques & Prompt Engineering

### 1. Model Selection Strategy

The application implements intelligent model detection and parameter adjustment:

**Reasoning Models (GPT-5, o1)**
- Use chain-of-thought processing for deeper analysis
- Require higher token limits (16,000 vs 4,000)
- No system messages (user messages only)
- No temperature control (model-optimized)
- Extended timeout (300 seconds)

**Standard Models (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5)**
- Direct response generation
- Standard token limits (2,000-4,000)
- System + user message structure
- Temperature control (0.1 for consistency)
- Standard timeout (300 seconds)

### 2. Prompt Engineering

**Structured Prompt Design:**

```javascript
const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are an autonomous cybersecurity analyst specializing in Censys host-data. Use Python for data analysis and web lookups for vulnerability enrichment.Do not output Python code

 Analyze the provided Censys host dataset and provide a comprehensive, in-depth security assessment. Your analysis should include: 
1. Overview: Dataset size, scope, and overall risk level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) 
2. Critical Findings**: Immediate security threats requiring urgent attention - Active malware/C2 infrastructure - Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS ‚â•7.0) with CVE numbers - Known exploited vulnerabilities 
3. Geographic & Infrastructure Patterns**: Notable hosting providers, ASNs, and geographic clustering 
4. Service Analysis: Exposed services, unusual ports, and authentication gaps 
5. Security Concerns: Misconfigurations, outdated software, and suspicious indicators 
6. Immediate Actions: Top 3 priority recommendations and key IOCs for blocking/monitoring 

Analyze the data systematically: 
- Inspect the data structure and identify key security indicators 
- Calculate statistics for ports, services, and geographic distribution 
- Identify high-risk patterns and anomalies - Cross-reference findings with known vulnerability databases 
- Provide evidence-based insights with specific examples from the data Format your final response as clear, structured text with bullet points. 
Prioritize actionable insights over descriptive analysis. Include specific technical details (CVE IDs, CVSS scores, ports, IPs) when relevant. 
Structure your output with proper capitlizations and formatting with section breaks for clarity. 

Dataset to Analyze:
{Data}`;
```

**Key Prompt Engineering Techniques:**
- **Role Definition**: Establishes expert cybersecurity analyst persona
- **Structured Output**: Enforces consistent 6-section format
- **Specificity**: Requests CVE IDs, CVSS scores, ports, IPs
- **Actionability**: Emphasizes recommendations over descriptions
- **Context Injection**: Embeds actual data within prompt

### 3. Error Handling & Resilience

- **File Format Error**: Invalid JSON processes as plain text
- **Token Management**: Automatic truncation with user notification
- **Timeout Handling**: Timeouts handled manually by user 
- **Multiple Models**: Supports multiple GPT models


## üìù Assumptions

1. **OpenAI API Access**: Users have a valid OpenAI API key with available quota
2. **Data Format**: Input data follows general Censys host data structure (flexible parsing)
3. **Internet Connectivity**: Active internet connection for API calls
4. **Modern Browser**: Recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
7. **Local Development**: Application runs on localhost (production deployment not configured)
8. **API Costs**: Users are aware of OpenAI API usage costs (varies by model)

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Stored server-side only, never exposed to frontend
- **Data Privacy**: File processing happens client-side when possible
- **Input Validation**: Sanitized data input and error handling
- **CORS**: Configured for local development (restrict in production)
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in .env (not committed)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"OpenAI API key configuration error"**
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in `server/.env`
- Restart backend server after changing .env
- Check API key is valid at OpenAI dashboard

**"Request timeout"**
- Normal for GPT-5/o1 reasoning models (up to 2-3 minutes)
- Try gpt-4o-mini for faster responses
- Reduce dataset size if timeout persists

**"Frontend not connecting to backend"**
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API_BASE_URL in App.jsx matches server port
